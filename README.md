# Discord-Bot-Sample-Code
This repository contains a sample code for a Discord music bot written in JavaScript. The code showcases essential music player functions and provides a foundation for building your own music bot.

Please note that this code is a demonstration and not intended to be run as-is. It was developed within a three-day timeframe, so the codebase may appear messier than it would be with regular maintenance.

Features
Playback Control: The bot allows users to play, pause, stop, skip, and seek through songs in a Discord voice channel.
Queue Management: Users can add songs to a queue and view the upcoming tracks.
Search and Play: The bot supports searching for songs on YouTube and playing them directly in the voice channel.
Looping: The bot provides the option to loop a song or the entire queue.
Error Handling: Proper error handling is implemented to handle scenarios such as invalid commands or unavailable songs.
